.SH NAME
ivs-ctl \- utility for configuring Indigo Virtual Switch
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB ivs-ctl help\fR
\fB ivs-ctl show\fR
\fB ivs-ctl add-port\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
\fB ivs-ctl add-internal-port\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
\fB ivs-ctl del-port\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
\fB ivs-ctl dump-flows\fR
\fB ivs-ctl list-ports\fR
\fB ivs-ctl trace\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBivs-ctl\fP command can be used to view and modify the \fBivs\fP virtual
switch datapath.
.PP
The \fBshow\fP command outputs information and statistics about the datapath,
including the attached ports.
.PP
The \fBadd-port\fP and \fBdel-port\fR commands modify the attached ports of
the datapath. The \fIINTERFACE\fR argument must be a Linux interface name.
.PP
The \fBadd-internal-port\fP command creates a Linux interface connected to
the datapath. This interface can have an IP address assigned to
it and can generally be used like a normal netdev, but traffic to and from it
will flow through the datapath.
.PP
The \fBdump-flows\fP command shows the contents of the kernel flowtable.
.PP
The \fBlist-ports\fP command shows the names of each attached port, one per line.
.PP
The \fBtrace\fP command explains the forwarding decision for each new flow.
